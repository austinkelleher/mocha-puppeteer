# mocha-puppeteer

A small tool for tests with [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha)
in Google Chrome using [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

*Note:* Still under dev. Nothing is really configurable right now. Come back later.

## Installation

```
npm i -D mocha-puppeteer
```

# Usage

To run your tests, you can pass a glob to the exposed cli tool.

```
npx mocha-puppeteer ./tests/**/*.js
```
